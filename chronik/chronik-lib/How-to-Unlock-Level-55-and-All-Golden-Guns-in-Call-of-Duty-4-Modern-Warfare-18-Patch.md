## How to Improve Your Skills
 
Hacking your profile and unlocking level 55 and all golden guns is not enough to make you a good player in Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. You also need to practice your skills and learn some tips and tricks that can give you an edge over your opponents. Here are some of them:

- Think movement through â Footsteps are loud in this game, so don't run around aimlessly. Make every movement count and use stealth when possible. Crouch, prone, or walk when you need to be quiet, and sprint only when you need to find cover or escape.
- Don't get tied down â While movement can be risky, so can staying in one spot for too long. You will become an easy target for snipers, grenades, and flanking enemies. Don't camp or hold a position for more than a few seconds, unless you have a good reason to do so.
- Pay attention to the map â Different maps encourage different styles of play. Some are more open and favor long-range weapons, while others are more close-quarters and favor shotguns and SMGs. Know the layout of each map, the best spots to hide, snipe, or ambush, and the common routes that enemies take.
- Use sprint to find cover, not to move â Sprinting is useful for getting out of danger or closing the gap with an enemy, but it also makes you more visible and vulnerable. You can't shoot while sprinting, and it takes time to recover from it. Use sprint sparingly and only when you have a clear destination in mind.

## How to Have More Fun
 
Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is not only a competitive game, but also a fun one. There are many ways to enjoy the game beyond the standard modes and rules. Here are some of them:

- Try different weapons and perks â Don't stick to the same loadout all the time. Experiment with different combinations of weapons, attachments, perks, and camouflages. You might discover new ways to play or new favorites that suit your style.
- Play with friends â Playing with friends is always more fun than playing alone or with strangers. You can communicate better, coordinate strategies, and have a good laugh together. You can also challenge each other to friendly matches or custom games with your own rules.
- Watch videos and streams â There are many videos and streams of Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare online that can entertain you or inspire you. You can watch pro players, funny moments, tips and tricks, glitches, mods, and more. You can also learn from other players' mistakes or successes.
- Try mods and custom maps â Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare has a vibrant modding community that has created many mods and custom maps for the game. You can download them from various websites or forums and install them on your PC. You can play new game modes, new weapons, new skins, new maps, and more.
